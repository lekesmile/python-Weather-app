Real sign of intelligence isn't knoweldge, it's imagination.
Live simply that others may simply live.
I only know one thing, and that is I know nothing.
Remember: life is a breath; Soon I will vanish from your sight. The eye that looks will not see me; You may search but I will be gone. Like a cloud fading in the sky, Man dissolves into death. And never comes home again.
My advice to you is to get married: Iif you find a good wife you'll be happy; If not, you'll become a philosophe.
I fear not the man who has practiced 10,000 kicks once, but I fear the man who has practiced one kick 10,000 times.
Life is like a box of chocolates, you never know what you're gonna get.
Do or do not, there is no try.
Always smile, that is the best way to cover the troubles behind your face.
